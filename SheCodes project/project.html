      <strong>Tailoring</strong> is the art of designing, cutting, fitting, and
      finishing clothes. The word tailor comes from the French tailler, to cut,
      and appears in the English language during the fourteenth century. In
      Latin, the word for tailor was sartor, meaning patcher or mender, hence
      the English "sartorial," or relating to the tailor, tailoring, or tailored
      clothing.
